# KittensHouse
WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge project.

About:

    My playground is an experience where you casually find an abandoned cat and decide to adopt it. However, you keep adopting more and more cats by the time. So the fun part is an AR Experience in which you can see, in your house, all the cats you adopted. You can discover more about each cat and even explore the environment with them just by changing their anchoring points.
    With that playground, I wanted to bring a fun and easy-going experience, while highlighting the importance of adoption(of cats or dogs), and also bringing the opportunity to have a pet for those who can't have one. A couple of weeks ago, I moved away from my mom's house and had to be a part of 3 pets of mine. It was difficult to be away from them, so the AR Experience was a nice way to feel less lonely. This shows the power of AR in the present day.
    Virtual and augmented reality will be more present in our lives in the coming years. Therefore, we, developers, have the power to bring people closer to each other, and create incursions and unimaginable experiences, despite any distance. It is even possible, for example, to have the opportunity to adopt a virtual pet and see it walking around your house.
    All cats in this playground are inspired by real-life cats of friends and relatives that rescued them from the streets. Those people showed great respect, abnegation, kindness, and love with their actions. 
    I believe that these are principles that we need to bring to technology in the coming days, to make the world a more welcoming place for those who are forsaken or suffering. As Mary Shelley showed us many years ago, a creation reflects its creator. If an application is not based on principles of respect, equality, and kindness, it can not suit our society.
    In that way, the power to create even more outstanding applications implies a great responsibility to our people.
